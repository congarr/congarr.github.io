                    <p>You are V, a cyberpunk. In a world of cyber enhanced street warriors, tech-savvy netrunners and corporate life-hackers, today is your first step to becoming an urban legend.	
                    Players will be able to play V as either male or female with full voice acting and will be able to choose a first and last name. Players will also be able to choose their future path with multiple branching quest-lines as well as pick their life-story (major life event, their reason for going to Night City, etc.) furthering the immersion and role playing aspects. A broad skill system means that there are no traditional classes, so players are free to experiment with abilities and perks.

                    <p>A gun for hire, Jackie is a highly skilled assassin. In the Wild West setting, he'd surely be a gunslinger or a bounty hunter. 2077 has him as a cyberpunk, just outside the big league. And he really wants to get into the game.
                            Jackie Welles is a character in the upcoming video game Cyberpunk 2077. He is one of V's early points of contact as well as the player's partner during several missions. He is Spanish-speaking and has no love for scavengers.
